# Promotion_Planning
# Multi-objective Optimisation
Optimize decision variables like discount and inventory for maximizing profit and lift of promotion planning.

Approaches mentioned over here NSGA II, NSGA III, UNSGA and RNSGA.
The creation and association of reference points are done using Das and Dennis approach.

In the codes, the decision variables like discount, inventory amount and budget for promotion are to be optimised to maximise or minimise the objective of promotional campaigns.
In this case, these are profit, sales and lift maximisation.
The optimal values of the decision variables would be computed using Multi-objective optimization algorithms with genetic algorithm.
